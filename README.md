# Axelerant: Front-end Interview

### Background

This exercise is to test your Front-end skills. You have to take the following [designs](./designs) and convert them to a website.

### Before you start

- Review the designs shared with you.
- Break the components as per [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
  - Following the same pattern Sass can be broken into partials that can be placed in `sass` directory. For naming classes follow [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) and [BEM](http://getbem.com/).
- Please avoid using Bootstrap, Foundation, or similar CSS frameworks

- You can start working on the implementation as per designs
- To update the markup update the `index.html` file
- You can write styles in `src/sass/styles.scss` and create new partials in that directory.
- You can add JS in `src/js/index.js`

#### But I want to use a framework like React/Angular?

- Feel free to do so!
- Create a new sandbox on Codesandbox with your framework of choice
